<h1>Daniel Boone Conservation Area</h1>

Daniel Boone Conservation Area is a place where the great pioneer himself might have felt at
home. Boone in fact lived near here in his golden years. A 6.8-mile multi-use trail invites hikers,
mountain bikers and equestrians to explore its deep valleys, woodlands, savannas, glades, and
rugged wooded hills. You'll also go through the Razor Hollow Natural Area along the way. For
those who enjoy a self-sufficient camping experience, Daniel Boone has multiple primitive
camping sites. You'll be sharing the space with a bevy of neotropical songbirds during the
spring as they 'camp' there during their travels.<br>

<h1>Little Lost Creek Conservation Area</h1>
Little Lost Creek is a partially spring-fed Ozark stream, characterized by clear water and a rocky
stream bed. Brilliantly colored Ozark fish species, such as bleeding shiners, southern red belly
dace, and stippled darters are found in the streams. The 2,899-acre area consists mostly of
oak/hickory forest, woodlands, and glades. A fall hike through the area provides visitors with
dazzling displays of fall color. The Little Lost Creek valleys and numerous side drainages feature
intermittent waterfalls, chutes, and outcrops of St. Peter sandstone, which provides habitat for
numerous fern species. Woodland wildlife, such as deer, turkey, squirrels and ruffed-grouse are
year-round residents. Pileated woodpeckers and other woodland birds are common most of the
year. The area also provides an important stopping point for numerous neotropical migrant
songbirds. Management of the forest at Little Lost Creek Conservation Area ensures that small
openings are available for the benefit of many wildlife species and provides a continuous
diversity of habitat. Fields of native grasses and forbs, woodlands, and glades are maintained
with prescribed fire. The area is steeped in history. Artifacts found in and around some of the
fields indicate that several tribes of Native Americans may have used the area for hunting
purposes. Daniel Boone homesteaded a few miles southeast of Little Lost Creek and it can be
assumed that he would have also hunted game here.<br>

It is St. Charles County’s largest park with 603 acres, including more than
10 miles of multi-use trails for hiking, biking, and equestrian use. Camping,
disc golf, fishing and an inclusive playground are just some of the amenities
found there. Situated at the confluence of Big Creek and Indian Camp
Creek, fishing is plentiful. A large lake on the property is stocked with
bluegill, bass, and catfish.<br>
History lovers will find the park exciting as well and will want to find their
way to the historical Cannon family cemetery. This cemetery has been
preserved on park property and has headstones dating back to the early
19th century. Additionally, a 'ghost structure' of the original log cabin built
in the late 1800s on the site still stands in the park. Climb to the top of the
restored silo, which serves as an observation tower, and discover the
beautiful prairies, vast wooded hills, and protected habit found throughout
the park.<br>
