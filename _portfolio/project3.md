Would you like to spend a quiet afternoon or evening in front of the fire?
Make a bag of complimentary popcorn and enjoy a board game. Books and/or
magazines can be found on the book shelf near the fireplace.<br>

If you prefer the outdoors, check out the following:
- Take a hike on the trail and view a few partial standing small buildings which we
left as history of the property.
- Take advantage of gathering around a fire at our custom-built fire pit with
complimentary wood and sâ€™mores.
- On the rear patio, enjoy soaking in the hot tub while facing the lake to relax and
enjoy the beauty of nature.
- Drift off to a nap in a hammock tucked between two trees near the lake.
