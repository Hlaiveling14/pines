**Daniel Boone’s Home** - On over 300 acres of land is a small historic village full of
original homes and other American frontier-time pieces. One of these buildings is the
home of legendary frontiersman Daniel Boone. His son, Nathan built the home when
they moved to Missouri from Kentucky. Self-guided tours are the best way that people
can visit the home, but along with the Daniel Boone Home, there are other buildings,
like a chapel, grist mill, school house, and a general store. This village is all part of
introducing guests to the life of the frontier pioneers. The home is four stories and
houses a room that once was a shop for Boone. Contact information - 1868 Highway F,
Defiance, MO 63341, Phone: 636-798-2005<br>
**Centennial Farms** - Operated since Missouri became a state in 1821, the Centennial
Farm has earned its name for being one of the few farms that have survived over 100
years. In 1854, the Knoerschild family bought the farm and is now on its sixth
generation of ownership. Today, guests to this National Historic site can still get farm-
fresh produce. In fact, in the summer months, guests can pick their own blueberries,
blackberries, and peaches. In the fall, guests can pick their own apples and pumpkins!
Beehives on the farm produce honey, which can be purchased in the farm store, as
well. Contact information - 199 Jackson Street, Augusta, MO 63332, Phone: 636-228-

**Eco Adventure Ziplines** - Eco Adventure Ziplines is Mid-Missouri’s most exciting zipline adventure. The facility
features over a mile of ziplines at heights up to 250 feet for amazing nature views! The
zipline course is unique and utilizes living trees and natural contours of the land to
provide an eco-friendly zipline adventure. We do not have big towers to climb, we gain
exciting elevation by utilizing the natural contours of the land. The course requires
minimal walking so you can instead zip through the trees and above the treetops.
